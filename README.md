# HAProxy 
The prupose of this repo is for me to learn more about HAProxy. 

Whenever possible I will try to use Docker only. However, in order to better understand what's going on, Vagrant will be used as well



For the project I will follow what is described in the following book:

"Load Balancing with HAProxy" - Nick Ramirez
